    #        weston.ini - configuration file for Weston - the reference Wayland compositor

    # INTRODUCTION

    #        Weston  obtains  configuration from its command line parameters and the configuration file
    #        described here.

    # DESCRIPTION

    #        Weston uses a  configuration  file  called  weston.ini  for  its  setup.   The  weston.ini
    #        configuration  file  is  searched  for  in  one of the following places when the server is
    #        started:

    #            $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/weston.ini   (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
    #            $HOME/.config/weston.ini      (if $HOME is set)
    #            weston/weston.ini in each
    #                $XDG_CONFIG_DIR           (if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is set)
    #            /etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini    (if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not set)
    #            <current dir>/weston.ini      (if no variables were set)

    #        where environment variable $HOME is the user's home directory, and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the
    #        user  specific  configuration  directory,  and  $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS  is a colon ':' delimited
    #        listed of configuration base directories, such as /etc/xdg-foo:/etc/xdg.

    #        The weston.ini file is composed of a number of sections which may be present in any order,
    #        or omitted to use default configuration values. Each section has the form:

    #            [SectionHeader]
    #            Key1=Value1
    #            Key2=Value2
    #                ...

    #        The spaces are significant.  Comment lines are ignored:

    #            #comment

    #        The section headers are:

    #            core           The core modules and options
    #            libinput       Input device configuration
    #            shell          Desktop customization
    #            launcher       Add launcher to the panel
    #            output         Output configuration
    #            input-method   Onscreen keyboard input
    #            keyboard       Keyboard layouts
    #            terminal       Terminal application options
    #            xwayland       XWayland options
    #            screen-share   Screen sharing options

    #        Possible  value types are string, signed and unsigned 32-bit integer, and boolean. Strings
    #        must not be quoted, do not support any escape sequences, and run till the end of the line.
    #        Integers  can  be  given  in  decimal (e.g. 123), octal (e.g. 0173), and hexadecimal (e.g.
    #        0x7b) form. Boolean values can be only 'true' or 'false'.

    # CORE SECTION

    #        The core section is used to select the startup compositor modules and general options.

    #        shell=desktop-shell.so
    #               specifies a shell to load (string). This can be used to load your  own  implemented
    #               shell or one with Weston as default. Available shells in the /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-
    #               gnu/weston directory are:

    #                  desktop-shell.so

    #        xwayland=true
    #               ask Weston to load the XWayland module (boolean).

    #        modules=cms-colord.so,screen-share.so
    #               specifies   the   modules   to   load   (string).   Available   modules   in    the
    #               /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/weston directory are:

    #                  cms-colord.so
    #                  screen-share.so

    #        backend=headless-backend.so
    #               overrides defaults backend. Available backend modules in the /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-
    #               gnu/weston directory are:

    #                  drm-backend.so
    #                  fbdev-backend.so
    #                  headless-backend.so
    #                  rdp-backend.so
    #                  wayland-backend.so
    #                  x11-backend.so

    #        repaint-window=N
    #               Set the approximate length of the  repaint  window  in  milliseconds.  The  repaint
    #               window  is used to control and reduce the output latency for clients. If the window
    #               is longer than the output refresh period, the repaint will be done immediately when
    #               the  previous  repaint  finishes, not processing client requests in between. If the
    #               repaint window is too short, the compositor may miss  the  target  vertical  blank,
    #               increasing  output  latency. The default value is 7 milliseconds. The allowed range
    #               is from -10 to 1000 milliseconds. Using a negative value will force the  compositor
    #               to always miss the target vblank.

    #        gbm-format=format
    #               sets  the GBM format used for the framebuffer for the GBM backend. Can be xrgb8888,
    #               xrgb2101010, rgb565.  By default, xrgb8888 is used.

    #        idle-time=seconds
    #               sets Weston's idle timeout in seconds. This idle timeout is the  time  after  which
    #               Weston  will  enter  an "inactive" mode and screen will fade to black. A value of 0
    #               disables the timeout.

    #               Important : This option may also be set via Weston's '-i' command line  option  and
    #               will  take  precedence  over  the  current  .ini  option.  This  means that if both
    #               weston.ini and command line define this idle-timeout time, the one specified in the
    #               command-line  will  be  used.  On  the other hand, if none of these sets the value,
    #               default idle timeout will be set to 300 seconds.

    #        require-input=true
    #               require an input device for launch

    #        pageflip-timeout=milliseconds
    #               sets Weston's pageflip  timeout  in  milliseconds.   This  sets  a  timer  to  exit
    #               gracefully  with a log message and an exit code of 1 in case the DRM driver is non-
    #               responsive.  Setting it to 0 disables this feature.

    # LIBINPUT SECTION

    #        The libinput section is used to configure input devices  when  using  the  libinput  input
    #        device backend.

    #        Available configuration are:

    #        enable_tap=true
    #               enables tap to click on touchpad devices

    # SHELL SECTION

    #        The  shell  section  is  used to customize the compositor. Some keys may not be handled by
    #        different shell plugins.

    #        The entries that can appear in this section are:

    #        client=file
    #               sets the path for the shell client to run. If not specified weston-desktop-shell is
    #               launched (string).

    #        background-image=file
    #               sets the path for the background image file (string).

    #        background-type=tile
    #               determines  how the background image is drawn (string). Can be scale, scale-crop or
    #               tile (default).  Scale means scaled to fit the  output  precisely,  not  preserving
    #               aspect  ratio.  Scale-crop preserves aspect ratio, scales the background image just
    #               big enough to cover the output, and centers it. The image ends up cropped from left
    #               and  right,  or top and bottom, if the aspect ratio does not match the output. Tile
    #               repeats the background image to fill the output.

    #        background-color=0xAARRGGBB
    #               sets the color of the background (unsigned integer). The  hexadecimal  digit  pairs
    #               are in order alpha, red, green, and blue.

    #        clock-format=format
    #               sets  the  panel clock format (string). Can be none, minutes, seconds.  By default,
    #               minutes format is used.

    #        panel-color=0xAARRGGBB
    #               sets the color of the panel (unsigned integer). The hexadecimal digit pairs are  in
    #               order transparency, red, green, and blue. Examples:

    #                  0xffff0000    Red
    #                  0xff00ff00    Green
    #                  0xff0000ff    Blue
    #                  0x00ffffff    Fully transparent

    #        panel-position=top
    #               sets the position of the panel (string). Can be top, bottom, left, right, none.

    #        locking=true
    #               enables screen locking (boolean).

    #        animation=zoom
    #               sets the effect used for opening new windows (string). Can be zoom, fade, none.  By
    #               default, no animation is used.

    #        close-animation=fade
    #               sets the effect used when closing windows (string). Can be fade, none.  By default,
    #               the fade animation is used.

    #        startup-animation=fade
    #               sets  the  effect  used  for  opening  new windows (string). Can be fade, none.  By
    #               default, the fade animation is used.

    #        focus-animation=dim-layer
    #               sets the effect used with the focused and  unfocused  windows.  Can  be  dim-layer,
    #               none.  By default, no animation is used.

    #        allow-zap=true
    #               whether  the  shell  should  quit  when  the  Ctrl-Alt-Backspace key combination is
    #               pressed

    #        binding-modifier=ctrl
    #               sets the modifier key used for common bindings (string), such as  moving  surfaces,
    #               resizing,  rotating,  switching,  closing and setting the transparency for windows,
    #               controlling the backlight and zooming the desktop.  Possible  values:  none,  ctrl,
    #               alt, super (default)

    #        num-workspaces=6
    #               defines the number of workspaces (unsigned integer). The user can switch workspaces
    #               by using the binding+F1, F2 keys. If  this  key  is  not  set,  fall  back  to  one
    #               workspace.

    #        cursor-theme=theme
    #               sets the cursor theme (string).

    #        cursor-size=24
    #               sets the cursor size (unsigned integer).

    #        lockscreen-icon=path
    #               sets the path to lock screen icon image (string). (tablet shell only)

    #        lockscreen=path
    #               sets the path to lock screen background image (string). (tablet shell only)

    #        homescreen=path
    #               sets the path to home screen background image (string). (tablet shell only)

    # LAUNCHER SECTION

    #        There can be multiple launcher sections, one for each launcher.

    #        icon=icon
    #               sets the path to icon image (string). Svg images are not currently supported.

    #        path=program
    #               sets the path to the program that is run by clicking on this launcher (string).  It
    #               is possible to pass  arguments  and  environment  variables  to  the  program.  For
    #               example:

    #                   path=GDK_BACKEND=wayland gnome-terminal --full-screen

    # OUTPUT SECTION

    #        There  can  be multiple output sections, each corresponding to one output. It is currently
    #        only recognized by the drm and x11 backends.

    #        name=name
    #               sets a name for the output (string). The backend uses  the  name  to  identify  the
    #               output. All X11 output names start with a letter X.  All Wayland output names start
    #               with the letters WL.  The available output names for DRM backend are listed in  the
    #               weston-launch(1) output.  Examples of usage:

    #                  LVDS1    DRM backend, Laptop internal panel no.1
    #                  VGA1     DRM backend, VGA connector no.1
    #                  X1       X11 backend, X window no.1
    #                  WL1      Wayland backend, Wayland window no.1

    #               See weston-drm(7) for more details.

    #        mode=mode
    #               sets  the output mode (string). The mode parameter is handled differently depending
    #               on the backend. On the X11 backend, it just sets the  WIDTHxHEIGHT  of  the  weston
    #               window.  The DRM backend accepts different modes:

    #                  WIDTHxHEIGHT    Resolution size width and height in pixels
    #                  preferred       Uses the preferred mode
    #                  current         Uses the current crt controller mode
    #                  off             Disables the output

    #               Optionally, a user may specify a modeline, such as:

    #                   173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync

    #               It  consists of the refresh rate in Hz, horizontal and vertical resolution, options
    #               for horizontal  and  vertical  synchronisation.  The  program  cvt(1)  can  provide
    #               suitable modeline string.

    #        transform=normal
    #               The  transformation applied to screen output (string). The transform key can be one
    #               of the following 8 strings:

    #                  normal        Normal output.
    #                  90            90 degrees clockwise.
    #                  180           Upside down.
    #                  270           90 degrees counter clockwise.
    #                  flipped       Horizontally flipped
    #                  flipped-90    Flipped and 90 degrees clockwise
    #                  flipped-180   Flipped upside down
    #                  flipped-270   Flipped and 90 degrees counter clockwise

    #        scale=factor
    #               The scaling multiplier applied to the entire output, in support of high  resolution
    #               ("HiDPI"  or "retina") displays, that roughly corresponds to the pixel ratio of the
    #               display's physical resolution to the logical resolution.  Applications that do  not
    #               support  high resolution displays typically appear tiny and unreadable. Weston will
    #               scale the output of such applications by this multiplier, to  make  them  readable.
    #               Applications  that  do  support  their own output scaling can draw their content in
    #               high resolution, in which case they avoid compositor scaling. Weston will not scale
    #               the output of such applications, and they are not affected by this multiplier.

    #               An integer, 1 by default, typically configured as 2 or higher when needed, denoting
    #               the scaling multiplier for the output.

    #        seat=name
    #               The logical seat name that that this output should be associated with. If  this  is
    #               set  then  the seat's input will be confined to the output that has the seat set on
    #               it. The expectation is that this  functionality  will  be  used  in  a  multiheaded
    #               environment  with a single compositor for multiple output and input configurations.
    #               The default seat is called "default" and will always be present. This seat  can  be
    #               constrained like any other.

    # INPUT-METHOD SECTION

    #        path=/usr/libexec/weston-keyboard
    #               sets the path of the on screen keyboard input method (string).

    # KEYBOARD SECTION

    #        This section contains the following keys:

    #        keymap_rules=evdev
    #               sets the keymap rules file (string). Used to map layout and model to input device.

    #        keymap_model=pc105
    #               sets the keymap model (string). See the Models section in xkeyboard-config(7).

    #        keymap_layout=us,de,gb
    #               sets  the  comma  separated list of keyboard layout codes (string). See the Layouts
    #               section in xkeyboard-config(7).

    #        keymap_variant=euro,,intl
    #               sets the comma separated list of keyboard layout variants (string). The  number  of
    #               variants  must  be the same as the number of layouts above. See the Layouts section
    #               in xkeyboard-config(7).

    #        keymap_options=grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll
    #               sets the keymap options (string). See the Options section in xkeyboard-config(7).

    #        repeat-rate=40
    #               sets the rate of repeating keys in characters per second (unsigned integer)

    #        repeat-delay=400
    #               sets the delay in milliseconds since key  down  until  repeating  starts  (unsigned
    #               integer)

    #        numlock-on=false
    #               sets  the  default  state  of  the numlock on weston startup for the backends which
    #               support it.

    #        vt-switching=true
    #               Whether to allow the use of Ctrl+Alt+Fn key combinations to switch  away  from  the
    #               compositor's virtual console.

    # TERMINAL SECTION

    #        Contains  settings  for  the  weston  terminal application (weston-terminal). It allows to
    #        customize the font and shell of the command line interface.

    #        font=DejaVu Sans Mono
    #               sets the font of the terminal (string). For a good experience it is recommended  to
    #               use monospace fonts. In case the font is not found, the default one is used.

    #        font-size=14
    #               sets the size of the terminal font (unsigned integer).

    #        term=xterm-256color
