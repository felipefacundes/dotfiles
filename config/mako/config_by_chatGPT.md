Mako is a notification daemon for the Wayland display server. Its configuration file is typically located at `~/.config/mako/config` and is a plain text file that can be edited with a text editor.

The `config` file contains settings for various aspects of Mako's behavior, including the position, size, and appearance of notifications. Here are some example settings that can be included in the `config` file:

```
# Set the default duration for notifications to 5 seconds
duration = 5000

# Set the position of notifications to the top right corner of the screen
position = top-right

# Set the default font family and size for notification text
font-family = sans-serif
font-size = 11

# Set the colors used for notification backgrounds and text
background-color = #333333
foreground-color = #ffffff

# Specify a command to run when a notification is clicked
on-click = notify-send "You clicked a notification!"
```

Mako's configuration file allows for a great deal of customization, so you can adjust it to fit your needs and preferences. Be sure to save the `config` file after making any changes, and then restart Mako to apply the new settings.
